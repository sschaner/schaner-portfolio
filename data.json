      "description": "I worked on an Agile team to create an app that searches for trails near a desired location. The result of the search will return weather details of the location, along with a list of trails to ride. The user is able to create an account or login to save a list of trails that they wish to ride. They can remove trails from this list as well. Backend functions written in C# connect to a SQL database on Azure. API's are used to retrieve information about weather and trails, as well as storing user information. This was a final capstone project for a full stack C# .NET bootcamp at Grand Circus.",
